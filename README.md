# Elixir GitLab API Scripts

This repository contains a collection of simple Elixir scripts as part of my ongoing experimentation with the Elixir language.
These scripts are designed to interact with the GitLab API to perform "useful" tasks.
The work here is related to my other project [breuvage](https://github.com/Lujeni/breuvage).

## Scripts

1. **Detect Inactive Projects**:
   - This script checks for projects on GitLab that have not had any commits in over a year.

```bash
make run
```
