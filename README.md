# gitlab-solowner

This repository contains a collection of simple Elixir scripts as part of my ongoing experimentation with the Elixir language.
These scripts are designed to interact with the GitLab API to perform "useful" tasks.
The work here is related to my other project [breuvage](https://github.com/Lujeni/breuvage).

# Usage

```bash
make local
elixir gitlab-solowner.exs
```
